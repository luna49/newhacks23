# Circuit Analysis: Pocket Edition
This is the repository for our NewHacks 2023 project.

It is a website which breaks down ECE110 (and similar introductory circuit courses) into smaller, digestible modules. Each module contains example problems, and practice problems in which students can submit and check their answers.
